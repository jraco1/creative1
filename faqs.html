        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
        <p>We are the resistance, the few humans who see the cracks in the alien's disguises and seek to throw off their yokes!</p>
        <h2>How do you afford such a fancy website?</h2>
        <p>It actually came free with our purchase of winzip.</p>
        <h2>What's with the photos?</h2>
        <p>The ailien's greatest strength lies in your disbelief of thier existance. Therefore, we are collecting all of the evidance we can to wake up the world. Our hope is you will seek out the photo locations and see the truth for yourself!</p>
        <h2>Are all polititions aliens?</h2>
        <p>NO! Some are human, some are aliens, and some are our fellow terrestrial lizard-people (They're on our side.)(We think.)(No, we don't know why they are stockpiling steak sauce.).</p>
        <p>Regardless, intentional or not, all of them sometimes make decisions that help the aliens tighten their control. Fight back! Vote well, vote often!</p>
        <h2>Should I be afriad?</h2>
        <p>....yes.</p>
        <h2>Crop circles?</h2>
        <p>Alien sneezes. Their allergies trigger when they first step out into our atmosphere.</p>
